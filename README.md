# netsage-grafana-configs

This repository contains the dashboard configuration files used by NetSage. The configuration files are managed using a tool called [wizzy](https://github.com/utkarshcmu/wizzy). A [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is provided that sets-up a Ubuntu environment with Grafana, wizzy, and required plugins to run a full NetSage instance. 

Please have a look at the documentation [here](https://netsage-project.github.io/netsage-grafana-configs/) or explore the [docs](docs/) folder.
